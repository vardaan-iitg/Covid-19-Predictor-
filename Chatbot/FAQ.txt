Coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

Symptoms of coronavirus are: a)fever b)cough c) difficulty in breathing.

In case of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing seek medical care early or call your health facility by telephone first.

While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19.

Prevention measures to protect yourself from virus:
a)keep at least 1-metre distance from others b)avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose  c)wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.

Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

Avoid going to crowded places where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).

When someone comes from another city, or state during covid19 Such persons shall be contacted by IDSP teams and interviewed about place of local residence.

Higher risks of getting affected from covid-19:
a)People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
b)People who have serious heart conditions
c)People who are immunocompromised.

There is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food as it generally spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.

Recovery time is about two weeks: People with mild disease
Recovery time is about three to six weeks: People with severe or critical disease.

It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.

Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from mail, packages or products However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses The 2019-nCOV is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children.

Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.

Prefer not to hang out with friends as the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing.

Cleaning is not an optimising method to kill germs, but it removes them from the cleaned surface which lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces.

Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water.

The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.



The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency.

Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous.

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e have a higher than normal body temperature) They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19.

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others because when someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.





Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19 Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease Physical distancing means being physically apart.

Corona test labs present in India are currently 579 ICMR approved testing labs present in India, 407 of which are government owned and the rest are private.

There is no specific treatment for disease caused by a novel coronavirus However, many of the symptoms can be treated and therefore treatment based on the patient’s clinical condition, Moreover, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.

T cells are known as immune warriors help us fight some viruses, but their importance for battling SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been unclear.

Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions.

CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.

Do not make your own sanitizers as CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concern over the correct use of ingredients and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.

CDC and partners are investigating to determine if a person can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.

Well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.



Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used.

CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels.



For good health, it is recommended that people should have adequate water every day for good health and to prevent dehydration.

When you come into contact with a corona positive patient you should self quarantine yourself firstly and then need to have a test of corona Self.
